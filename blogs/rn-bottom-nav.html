          Creating a Customized Bottom Navigation in React Native ðŸ“±
        </h1>
        <p>
          First, let's understand understand how the bottom navigation works.
          The bottom navigation behaves like a stack of screens, where each tab
          is an individual screen. When a tab is clicked, the corresponding
          screen is pushed to the top of the stack. This allows the user to
          navigate between screens by switching tabs. Imagine a stack of cards
          where each card represents a screen. When a tab is clicked, the
          corresponding card is brought to the top of the stack.

        <h3>Creating the bottom navigation</h3>
        <p>
          To create the bottom navigation, let's create the bottom navigation
          component. We are going to named it <code>BottomNav</code>. Here we
          are going to have the main navigation with the screens we want to
          display. In the <code>tabBar</code> we are going to call the
          <code>CustomBottomNav</code> component and pass all the props.

        <h3>Styling the bottom navigation</h3>
        <p>
          To style the bottom navigation, we can use the
          <code>StyleSheet</code> component from React Native. Also,we are going
          to create a new component called <code>CustomBottomNav</code> which
          had been called where we defined the bottom navigation . Now we can
          define the styles for the navigation bar. In the next step we are
          going to create a component called <code>CustomMenuIcon</code> to
          style the icons

        <h3>Creating custom icons</h3>
        <p>
          To create the custom icons, we need to create a new component called
          <code>CustomMenuIcon</code>. This component will contain the tabs'
          icons and the animation logic for when the users tap on them.
          Moreover, We can also define different styles for the active tab to
          indicate which tab is currently selected. In this case, added
          animation to the icon when it is tapped and the color when the icons
          are focused.

        <h3>Using the bottom navigation</h3>
        <p>
          To use the bottom navigation in our app, we simply need to import the
          <code>BottomNav</code> component and add it to our main app component.
          We can pass the tab components as children to the
          <code>NavigationContainer</code> component, and it will take care of
          rendering the tabs and switching between them.
